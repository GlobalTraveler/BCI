= Task =
- Cybathalon 4: Zero-training adaptive classification systems
- use a backlog for Bayesian approach
- Idea: try with and without training and see if updating improves performance
- Idea: train different classifiers on backlog data and see which performs best


= Steps =
- look at data (provided data)
-- what is its nature
- which clsfrs do we want to use?
- skeleton for connection between game and our thing
- Bayesian framework
